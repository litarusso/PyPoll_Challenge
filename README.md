## Summary

In addition, our project was a success and made the analyzing process accessible and quicker with high accuracy. 
We can repeatedly use this project for any elections with some changes to the data or codes. For example, we can extract data from another area or make charts to understand the results better.
Our proposal for the "Pypoll Election Modul" will be sent to you by our sales department.
